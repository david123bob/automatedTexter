Currently this code only works for automating sending emails and texts will only work if you ask for 
provider beforehand. Working on a fix but prob will try diffrent method

 Before use must ensure gmail has enabled third party addons
 to do this go to https://myaccount.google.com/ -> security -> enable two step verifcation
 once you are done click on two step verification again -> app passwords ->name it anything (name doesnt matter)
 it will give you a temporary password like irpx bpmu ozne fybr 
 you will put this information in sender_credentials with the first variable being username and 2nd variable
 being the temporary password

Now for the file there are multiple options. If you made a google form go to view in sheets. Next click on 
share, make sure its editor and finally get the link. It should look like this
:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14G4rlx1aTXdQ--nQ4Ltbpc8XDQu6RUVs71xvOHYdP5Q/edit?usp=sharing
Now you want to take everything before the d/ so 14G4rlx1aTXdQ--nQ4Ltbpc8XDQu6RUVs71xvOHYdP5Q/edit?usp=sharing
 and put it into sheet id. Finally change the column that contains the emails to email instead of the question

If you have donwloaded the csv file (excel file) put it into folder, remove sheet id and simply set 
df=pd.read_csv(fileName). Finally change the column that contains the emails to email instead of the question

Now you can simply change what the message and subject is and run the code to send out emails. Note emails
will fail if they fail to include a email or spell it wrong 

For phone numbers I am still working on it having difficulties.

Extra:If you want to send a email with attchments that will require more effort so here the instructions below:
Instead of send_email you will use send_email_attachments and it will require 1 extra parameters which is 
simplify the file names. Note you should put the file in the same folder as the code.
